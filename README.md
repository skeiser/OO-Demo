## OO-Demo
Stuff for OOO Training

We are going to be talking about 4 different principles (Stool Legs) of OO Programming.

- Encapsulation : 
    - The grouping together of properties and methods
    - Properties modified by internal controlling methods

- Abstraction
    - Hiding more complicated functionality
    - What the object does, not how it does it
    - Way of dealing with ideas rather than events

- Inheritance
    - Classes inheriting attributes and methods from parent classes
    - Implementing interfaces
- Polymorphism
    - Static polymorphism - Method overloading
    - Dynamic polymorphism - Method overriding

# SOLID 
- Single Responsibility Principle(SRP)
> Every object should have a single responsibility, and that responsiblility should be entirely encapsulated by the class -- Wikipedia

> There should never be more than one reason for a class to change -- Robert Martin

- Open/Closed principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Separation of Concerns

# Open/Closed Principle(O)
Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification -- Wikipedia
- Inheritance / Template Method Pattern
- Composition / Strategy Pattern

# Liskov Substitution Principle(L)

- Child class is-a base class
- LSP suggests child class is substitutable-for a base clase

# Interface Segregation Principle

- Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use

# Dependency Inversion Principle

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.
